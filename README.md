# BFSModifications
Modifications of Breadth First Search

through1 - prefers path through vertex 1

through_odd - prefers most number of odd verticies 

num_path - returns the number of shortest paths

cycle - prints the edges that creates a cycle

consistent - each edge is labeled with 1 if verticies are same color and 0 if different. returns true if labels are consistent with 2 colors

Made for Computer Algorithms in Fall 2016.
